# Updating

## Update to latest version

Navigate with your CLI to the directory where you've installed the script and enter:

``` bash
$ git pull origin master
```

This requires that the platform was installed with Git and will update all modified, deleted and added files.

## Find your current version

You can find your current version in the file `/core/app/config/version.php`.
