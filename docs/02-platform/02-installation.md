# Installation

## Upload files

The preferred way of installing is with Git, because this makes it easy to update.

With your CLI, go to the webroot of your hosting account and type:

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/madewithpepper/Pulse-Proximity-Platform.git .
```
If you don't want to use Git, you can simply upload all files to the webroot. The webroot can be the root of a domain or subdomain.

## Folder permissions

Make sure these folders are writable:

 - `attachments/`
 - `uploads/`
 - `core/bootstrap/cache/`
 - `core/storage/` and all underlying folders

## Configuration file

Copy `core/.env.example` to `.env` and open the file with a text editor.

> In Windows, you have to enter a space and a dot after `.env` to rename the file. Like this: `.env .` and press enter.

Open the file and modify the configuration, there're explanations for most settings included. After you've updated the file and saved it, open the URL where you've installed the script and the database will be migrated and seeded automatically.

> You have to create the MySQL database yourself.

This is what the default configuration file looks like:

``` bash
# Name and icon for app

APP_NAME="Proximity Platform"
APP_ICON="assets/images/logos/icon.svg"

# Set APP_DEBUG to true if you get the message "Whoops, looks like something went wrong.".
# After installation you can set it to false.

APP_DEBUG=true

# After deploying the files to your server (with `git clone` or by uploading),
# `cd` to the `core` directory and run (e.g. `cd var/www/pulse/core`):
# `php artisan key:generate`
# This will generate a new app key.
