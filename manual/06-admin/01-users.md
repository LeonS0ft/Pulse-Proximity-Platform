# Users
In the admin section, an administrator can view, edit and delete users. Navigate to `Admin > Users > Users` to see a list of all users.

## Impersonate a user
It's possible to impersonate a user by clicking the `Login` button in the `Actions` column.

## Resellers
Resellers can only see users within their domain. Only a user with the `Owner` role can see all users within the system.
