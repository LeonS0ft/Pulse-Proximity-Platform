# Resellers
Resellers can be managed at `Admin > Users > Resellers`. A reseller has his or her own domain and plans. Each reseller has one account owner who can view and manage all users who registered at the reseller's  domain. And manage things like plans.

## Domain
In order to use this feature, the system owner needs to set up the reseller's domain with a wildcard DNS or regular DNS setting. The reseller points his or her domain's CNAME or A name to the server where the platform is installed.
