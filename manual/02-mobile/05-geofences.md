# Geofences

A geofence, or geo-fence, is a geographic area. This can be a polygon, but in the case of the Pulse platform it's a single point on the map with a radius.

## Manage geofences
In the web platform you can add, remove or update beacons at `Mobile > Geofences`.

> Geofences are not accurate. They are device dependent and you need to move at least a couple of meters in order to trigger a change. In case of an iPhone, you might even need to move a couple of hundred meters. The radius of a geofence should be at least 50 meter.
