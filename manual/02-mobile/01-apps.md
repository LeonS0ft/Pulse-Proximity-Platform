# Apps
Apps can be found at `Mobile > Apps`. An app in the platform is basically an API token which can be used in the [proximity app](https://github.com/madewithpepper/Pulse-Proximity-App).

Apps are linked to campaigns and since the app's API token is entered in the proximity app (`src/appConfig.ts`), the proximity app knows what scenarios to trigger.
