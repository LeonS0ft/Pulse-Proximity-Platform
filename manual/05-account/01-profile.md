# Profile
Each user can update generic settings like email, name, password, timezone and an avatar at the `Account` tab. At the left side there is a navigation, but the `profile` page is selected by default.

## Localization
When dates and times shown in the system are incorrect, make sure to configure the right timezone at the `Localization` tab.
