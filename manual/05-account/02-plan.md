# Plan
A user can upgrade his or her plan by clicking the `Account` tab, and then choose the `Plan` option at the navigation on the left side. Alternatively, a user can click the avatar on the right top and choose `Plan` directly.

## Free plan
By default, every user starts with a free plan. A free plan has no permission to do anything.
