# Media
With the media browser a user can upload, delete and modify files. You can open the media browser by clicking the `Media` tab.

## Multi-user
Each user has his or her own folder. Don't use the media browser for sensitive data, because files residing in it can be accessed by the web. For example, it's used to manage images which are shown in the app. And thus have to be accessed by an external source.

## robots.txt
With the `robots.txt` file it's possible to prevent search engine crawlers to index the files, but that's no guarantee they are not found.
